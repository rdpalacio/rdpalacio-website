I do research to strengthen the conservation of biodiversity with scientific evidence, and to provide insights that match on-the-ground preservation efforts. 

My research topics include biological surveys and monitoring, habitat restoration, community ecology and species distribution models. I mostly study birds and use spatial analysis to determine conservation priorities. 

You can find a list of my published papers in [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ruben_Dario_Palacio) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jRGXJK4AAAAJ&hl=en). I have published many of these papers in top peer-reviewed journals.

Below is a gallery of some of the publications and technical reports I have worked on. Click on each thumbnail for a larger image and a short description.
