**What I'm doing right now?**
*(updated June, 2022)*

I just graduated in May from my PhD at Duke. I have always wanted to go back to Colombia and put all my skills into the conservation of nature in my region. Thus, I am grant writing like crazy to raise funds for my non-profit [Fundacion Ecotonos](https://www.ecotonos.org)

I am also working on producing technical courses on SIG, stats, and writing scientific papers.

Right now I am living off my savings. I hope my fundraising activities and courses will be successful, to prevent me from getting a job outside of what I love, that is, working for the conservation of nature.
